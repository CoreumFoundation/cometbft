## CheckTx

In ABCI, the `CheckTx` method is used to check the validity of an individual transaction before it is included in a block. It is called by the state replication engine for each transaction that is received.

The `CheckTx` method is responsible for performing any necessary validation checks on the transaction, such as verifying the signature, checking for double spending, or enforcing application-specific rules. It is a lightweight and fast operation, as it is meant to quickly determine whether a transaction is valid or not.

The method takes in a `RequestCheckTx` object, which contains the transaction to be checked (`req.Tx`) and any other relevant information that the application needs to validate the transaction.

The `CheckTx` method should return a `ResponseCheckTx` object, which indicates whether the transaction is valid or not. If the transaction is valid, the response may include additional information about the transaction or any changes to the application state resulting from the validation.

**Following is the blurb of code for the `CheckTx` function:**

```go
func (app ForumApp) CheckTx(ctx context.Context, checktx *abci.RequestCheckTx) (*abci.ResponseCheckTx, error) {
    // Parse the tx message
    msg, err := model.ParseMessage(checktx.Tx)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("failed to parse transaction message checktx: %v\n", err)
        return &abci.ResponseCheckTx{Code: CodeTypeInvalidTxFormat, Log: "Invalid transaction format"}, nil
    }

    u, err := app.state.DB.FindUserByName(msg.Sender)

    if err != nil {
        if !errors.Is(err, badger.ErrKeyNotFound) {
            fmt.Println("problem in check tx: ", string(checktx.Tx))
            return &abci.ResponseCheckTx{Code: CodeTypeEncodingError}, nil
        }
        fmt.Println("Not found user :", msg.Sender)
    } else {
        if u != nil && u.Banned {
            return &abci.ResponseCheckTx{Code: CodeTypeBanned, Log: "User is banned"}, nil
        }
    }

    return &abci.ResponseCheckTx{Code: CodeTypeOK}, nil
}
```

**Explanation of code:**

`CheckTx` function parses the transaction message contained in `checktx.Tx` using the model.ParseMessage function. If there is an error parsing the message, it prints an error message and returns a response with an error code indicating an invalid transaction format.

Then it, searches for a user in the database using the `app.state.DB.FindUserByName` function. If the user is not found, it prints a message indicating that the user was not found. If there is an error other than a key not found error, it prints an error message and returns a response with an error code indicating an encoding error.

If the user is found and is not banned, it returns a response with a success code.

Finally, it prints a success message indicating the success of the check transaction.

*Tip: The function `CheckTx` is a stateless function that is primarily used by the application to check if the tx is being correctly formatted or not.*

Note: You will learn about different packages and functions like `app.state.DB.FindUserByName` in the upcoming sections. In this section you will learn about `app.go` file only.

## PrepareProposal

The `PrepareProposal` method is used to prepare a proposal for the next block in the blockchain. It is called by the state replication engine to request a proposal from the application.

The `PrepareProposal` method is responsible for creating the contents of the proposed block, typically by selecting a set of transactions that should be included in the next block. It may use various criteria to determine which transactions to include, such as transaction fees, priority, or application-specific rules (as defined by the application).

The method takes in a `RequestPrepareProposal` object, which contains information about the current state of the blockchain, such as the current height and the last committed block hash. It may also include other relevant information that the application needs to generate the proposal.

The `PrepareProposal` method should return a `ResponsePrepareProposal` object, which includes the proposed block contents. This typically includes the list of transactions (txs) that should be included in the next block.

**Following is the blurb of code for the `PrepareProposal` function:**

```go
func (app *ForumApp) PrepareProposal(_ context.Context, proposal *abci.RequestPrepareProposal) (*abci.ResponsePrepareProposal, error) {

  voteExtensionCurseWords := app.getWordsFromVe(proposal.LocalLastCommit.Votes)

  // prepare proposal puts the BanTx first, then adds the other transactions
  // ProcessProposal should verify this
  proposedTxs := make([][]byte, 0)
  finalProposal := make([][]byte, 0)
  bannedUsersString := make(map[string]struct{})
  for _, tx := range proposal.Txs {
    msg, err := model.ParseMessage(tx)
    if err != nil {
        continue
    }

    // Adding the curse words from vote extensions too
    if !IsCurseWord(msg.Message, voteExtensionCurseWords) {
        proposedTxs = append(proposedTxs, tx)
    } else {
            banTx := model.BanTx{UserName: msg.Sender}
            bannedUsersString[msg.Sender] = struct{}{}
            resultBytes, err := json.Marshal(banTx)
            if err == nil {
                finalProposal = append(finalProposal, resultBytes)
            } else {
                    panic(fmt.Errorf("ban transaction failed to marshal in prepareProposal"))
                }
        }
    }

    for _, tx := range proposedTxs {
        msg, err := model.ParseMessage(tx)
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
        if _, ok := bannedUsersString[msg.Sender]; !ok {
            finalProposal = append(finalProposal, tx)
        }
    }

        return &abci.ResponsePrepareProposal{Txs: finalProposal}, nil
}
```

**Explanation of code:**

`PrepareProposal` function first retrieves curse words from a `vote extension.` Then, it iterates over the transactions in the proposal and checks if each transaction contains curse words. If a transaction does not contain curse words, it adds it to the `proposedTxs` slice. If a transaction does contain curse words, it creates a ban transaction and adds it to the `finalProposal` slice.

After iterating over all the transactions, it loops through the `proposedTxs` again to make sure there are no transactions left from users who were banned after their transactions were accepted. The final set of transactions is stored in the `finalProposal` slice, which is then returned as part of the `ResponsePrepareProposal` response.

*Tip: The function `PrepareProposal` is used by state replication to indicate to the application to begin processing the tx. Typically, the application is expected to order the tx and remove tx from pool as defined by application logic.*

Note: You will learn about different packages and functions like `model.ParseMessage` in the upcoming sections. In this section you will learn about `app.go` file only.

## ProcessProposal

The `ProcessProposal` method is used to process a proposal for the next block in the blockchain. It is called by the state replication engine to request the application to validate and potentially execute the proposed block.

The `ProcessProposal` method is responsible for performing any necessary validation checks on the proposed block, such as verifying the validity of the included transactions, checking for double spending, or enforcing application-specific rules (as defined by the application). It may also update the application state or perform additional computations based on the proposed block.

The method takes in a `RequestProcessProposal` object, which contains the proposed block contents, including the list of transactions (`req.Txs`) that are included in the block.

The `ProcessProposal` method should return a `ResponseProcessProposal` object, which indicates whether the proposed block is valid and should be committed to the blockchain. If the proposed block is valid, the response may include additional information about the execution results or any changes to the application state.

**Following is the blurb of code for the `ProcessProposal` function:**

```go
func (ForumApp) ProcessProposal(_ context.Context, processproposal *abci.RequestProcessProposal) (*abci.ResponseProcessProposal, error) {

    bannedUsers := make(map[string]struct{}, 0)
    finishedBanTxIdx := len(processproposal.Txs)

    for i, tx := range processproposal.Txs {
        if isBanTx(tx) {
            var parsedBan model.BanTx
            err := json.Unmarshal(tx, &parsedBan)
            if err != nil {
                return &abci.ResponseProcessProposal{Status: abci.ResponseProcessProposal_REJECT}, nil
            }
            bannedUsers[parsedBan.UserName] = struct{}{}
        } else {
            finishedBanTxIdx = i
            break
        }
    }

    for _, tx := range processproposal.Txs[finishedBanTxIdx:] {
        // From this point on, there should be no BanTxs anymore
        // If there is one, ParseMessage will return an error as the
        msg, err := model.ParseMessage(tx)
        if err != nil {
            return &abci.ResponseProcessProposal{Status: abci.ResponseProcessProposal_REJECT}, nil
        }
        if _, ok := bannedUsers[msg.Sender]; ok {
        // sending us a tx from a banned user
            return &abci.ResponseProcessProposal{Status: abci.ResponseProcessProposal_REJECT}, nil
        }
    }

    return &abci.ResponseProcessProposal{Status: abci.ResponseProcessProposal_ACCEPT}, nil
}
```

**Explanation of code:**

`ProcessProposal` function initializes an empty map called `bannedUsers` to keep track of banned user names.

Then, it iterates through the transactions and checks if each transaction is a ban transaction using the `isBanTx` function. If it is a ban transaction, it parses the transaction into a `BanTx` struct and adds the banned user's name to the `bannedUsers` map. If it is not a ban transaction, it breaks out of the loop and records the index of the last ban transaction.

After that, it iterates through the remaining transactions (starting from the index after the last ban transaction) and parses each transaction using the `model.ParseMessage` function. If any banned user attempts to send a transaction, it rejects the proposal.

Finally, if there are no banned users found in the transactions, it accepts the proposal.

*Tip: The function `ProcessProposal` is used by state replication to indicate to the application to process the tx. The application can process a tx in accoradance to the logic defined by the application. Although the application can perform 'optimisitic execeution', the application is not mandated to do so.*

Note: You will learn about different packages and functions like `isBanTx` in the upcoming sections. In this section you will learn about `app.go` file only.

## FinalizeBlock

The `FinalizeBlock` method is used to finalize a block in the blockchain. It is called by the state replication engine after all the transactions in a block have been processed and the block is ready to be added to the blockchain.

The `FinalizeBlock` method takes in a `RequestFinalizeBlock` object, which contains information about the block being finalized. It performs any necessary processing or validation on the block, such as updating the application state, or performing additional computations.

After processing the block, the method returns a `ResponseFinalizeBlock` object, which typically includes the results of the block finalization process, such as the transaction results or the new state hash.

**Following is the blurb of code for the `FinalizeBlock` function:**

```go
func (app *ForumApp) FinalizeBlock(_ context.Context, req *abci.RequestFinalizeBlock) (*abci.ResponseFinalizeBlock, error) {

    // Iterate over Tx in current block
    app.onGoingBlock = app.state.DB.GetDB().NewTransaction(true)
    respTxs := make([]*abci.ExecTxResult, len(req.Txs))
    finishedBanTxIdx := len(req.Txs)

    for i, tx := range req.Txs {
        var err error
        if isBanTx(tx) {
            banTx := new(model.BanTx)
            err = json.Unmarshal(tx, &banTx)
            if err != nil {
                respTxs[i] = &abci.ExecTxResult{Code: CodeTypeEncodingError}
            } else {
                err := UpdateOrSetUser(app.state.DB, banTx.UserName, true, app.onGoingBlock)
                if err != nil {
                    panic(err)
                }
                respTxs[i] = &abci.ExecTxResult{Code: CodeTypeOK}
            }
        } else {
            finishedBanTxIdx = i
            break
        }
    }

    for idx, tx := range req.Txs[finishedBanTxIdx:] {
        // From this point on, there should be no BanTxs anymore
        // If there is one, ParseMessage will return an error as the
        msg, err := model.ParseMessage(tx)
        i := idx + finishedBanTxIdx
        if err != nil {
            respTxs[i] = &abci.ExecTxResult{Code: CodeTypeEncodingError}
        } else {
            // Check if this sender already existed; if not, add the user too
            err := UpdateOrSetUser(app.state.DB, msg.Sender, false, app.onGoingBlock)
            if err != nil {
                panic(err)
            }
            // Add the message for this sender
            message, err := model.AppendToExistingMsgs(app.state.DB, *msg)
            if err != nil {
                panic(err)
            }
            app.onGoingBlock.Set([]byte(msg.Sender+"msg"), []byte(message))
            chatHistory, err := model.AppendToChat(app.state.DB, *msg)
            if err != nil {
                panic(err)
            }
            // Append messages to chat history
            app.onGoingBlock.Set([]byte("history"), []byte(chatHistory))
            // This adds the user to the DB, but the data is not committed nor persisted until Commit is called
            respTxs[i] = &abci.ExecTxResult{Code: abci.CodeTypeOK}
            app.state.Size++
        }
    }

    app.state.Height = req.Height
    response := &abci.ResponseFinalizeBlock{TxResults: respTxs, AppHash: app.state.Hash()}
    return response, nil
}
```

**Explanation of code:**

`FinalizeBlock` function iterates over the transactions (`req.Txs`) in the block. If a transaction is a ban transaction (`isBanTx(tx)`), it updates or sets a user in the application's database and assigns a response code. If it is not a ban transaction, the loop breaks.

After the ban transactions, the method parses the remaining transactions using `model.ParseMessage(tx)`. It updates or sets the sender as a user in the database, appends the message to the existing messages, appends the message to the chat history, and assigns a response code. Finally, it updates the blockchain state and returns the response object.

*Tip: The function `FinalizeBlock` finalizes processing of a tx. All the state change that happen in this function function are finalized. However, they are not yet persisted to database. This is done in next step, i.e. `Commit`*

Note: You will learn about different packages and functions like `model.AppendToExistingMsgs` in the upcoming sections. In this section you will learn about `app.go` file only.

## Commit

The `Commit` method is used to persist the changes made to the application state during the FinalizeBlock method.

After calling `FinalizeBlock`, the state changes are finalized but not yet persisted to the database. The `Commit` method is responsible for persisting these changes to the database, ensuring that they are durable and can be retrieved later.

Typically, the `Commit` method updates the application's blockchain state by saving the modified data to a persistent storage system, such as a database or a file. This allows the application to maintain a consistent and reliable state across different blocks in the blockchain.

The Commit method takes in a `RequestCommit` object and returns a `ResponseCommit` object, which can include information about the `commit` process, such as the new state hash or any errors that occurred during the commit.

**Following is the blurb of code for the `Commit` function:**

```go
func (app ForumApp) Commit(_ context.Context, commit *abci.RequestCommit) (*abci.ResponseCommit, error) {
    if err := app.onGoingBlock.Commit(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    saveState(&app.state)
    return &abci.ResponseCommit{}, nil
}
```

**Explanation of code:**

The `Commit` method takes in a `context.Context` object and a `*abci.RequestCommit` object as parameters. It returns a `*abci.ResponseCommit` object and an error.

Inside the method, it calls the Commit method on `app.onGoingBlock`, which is an instance of a block object. This commits the state changes made during the `FinalizeBlock` method to the underlying storage system. If there's an error during the `commit`, it panics with the error.

After the state changes are committed, the `saveState` function is called with a pointer to `app.state.` This function is responsible for persisting the updated state to a persistent storage system.

Finally, the method returns an empty `*abci.ResponseCommit` object and a `nil` error.
