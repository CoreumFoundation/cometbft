# Forum Application

In this tutorial, we will build a Forum application using `ABCI 2.0`. A Forum is an application where people can discuss
topics by posting messages and responding to each other. Each discussion within a forum is typically structured as a
thread where the original post starts the conversation, and subsequent replies can be viewed in chronological order or
sometimes organized by relevance or voting.

We will demonstrate the use of `ABCI 2.0` methods like - `CheckTx`, `PrepareProposal`, `ProcessProposal`, `FinalizeBlock`
and `VerifyVoteExtension`

## What does the application do?

For the sake of simplicity, we will not be developing a fully functioning Forum Application. In our tutorial, we will focus
on `sender` and `messages` and the censorship of ill-behaved forum uses.

The **Forum application** accepts `sender` and `message` as input and checks if the `sender`
has been banned or not. If the `sender` is banned, it cannot send a `message` on the Forum.

If the `sender` is not banned, the `message` is checked for any curse words. If the `message` contains any curse words, the
`sender` is banned. If not, the `message` is persisted in the application state.

*Note: Curse words are defined in genesis, a copy of which is available with all nodes. To add a new curse word, the
node must use `VoteExtension`*

### Application Structure with VE

Here is an example of how the tutorial directory structure can be defined.

- `abci`
    - `app.go`
    - `config.go`
    - `state.go`
    - `util.go`
- `model`
    - `db.go`
    - `messages.go`
    - `user.go`
- `config/config.go`
- `config/config.toml`
- `main.go`

Forum Application.*
