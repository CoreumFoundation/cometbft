# Run Application

In this section you will learn how to run the `Forum Application.` In previous sections you learned about different ABCI 2.0 methods and how they are used.

## Initializing and Running

The application is almost ready to run, but first we'll need to populate the CometBFT [configuration](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/v0.38.x/docs/core/configuration.md) files. The following command will create a cometbft-home directory in your project and add a basic set of configuration files in ~/config/. For more information on what these files contain see the configuration documentation.

From the root of your project, run:

```go
go run github.com/cometbft/cometbft/cmd/cometbft@v0.38.0 init
```

You should see an output similar to the following:

```bash
I[2023-04-25|09:06:34.444] Generated private validator                  module=main keyFile=/tmp/cometbft-home/config/priv_validator_key.json stateFile=/tmp/cometbft-home/data/priv_validator_state.json
I[2023-04-25|09:06:34.444] Generated node key                           module=main path=/tmp/cometbft-home/config/node_key.json
I[2023-04-25|09:06:34.444] Generated genesis file                       module=main path=/tmp/cometbft-home/config/genesis.json
```

Now rebuild the app (use `-mod=mod` to automatically refresh the dependencies):

```go
go build -mod=mod
```

Everything is now in place to run your application. Run:

```bash
./forum
```

This should start the full node and connect to our ABCI application, which will be reflected in the application output.

```

Also, the application using CometBFT Core is producing blocks ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ and you can see this reflected in the log output of the service in lines like this:

```

## Using the application

Let's try submitting a transaction to our new application. Open another terminal window and run the following curl command:

### Submit a tx with non curse word

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/broadcast_tx_commit?tx="sender:Ron,message:Music"'
```

If everything went well, you should see a response indicating which height the transaction was included in the blockchain.

```bash
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":-1,"result":{"check_tx":{"code":0,"data":null,"log":"","info":"","gas_wanted":"0","gas_used":"0","events":[],"codespace":""},"tx_result":{"code":0,"data":null,"log":"","info":"","gasWanted":"0","gasUsed":"0","events":[],"codespace":""},"hash":"DD0DD9613C83E5CCDE31342DC49CEF1DD6423271B090BC6A73E800FD163E7ADD","height":"786"}}%
```

Let's make sure that transaction really was persisted by the application. Run the following command:

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/abci_query?data="Ron"'
```

Let's examine the response object that this request returns. The request returns a `json` object with a `key` and `value` field set.

```bash
{

    "key": "Um9u",
    "value": "Ik11c2ljIg==",
}
```

Those values don't look like the key and value we sent to CometBFT. What's going on here?

The response contains a base64 encoded representation of the data we submitted. To get the original value out of this data, we can use the base64 command line utility:

```bash
echo Ik11c2ljIg== | base64 -d
```

As you can observe, **music** was added, as message from Ron.

### Submit a tx with curse word

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/broadcast_tx_commit?tx="sender:Malfoy,message:muggle"'
```

After a certain amount of time you will see a message that tx could not be included in the block. This happens as tx is being rejected in `PrepareProposal`

```bash
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":-1,"error":{"code":-32603,"message":"Internal error","data":"timed out waiting for tx to be included in a block"}}
```

Let's make sure that transaction really was not persisted by the application. Run the following command:

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/abci_query?data="Malfoy"'
```

Let's examine the response object that this request returns. The request returns a `json` object with a `key` and `value` field set.

```bash
{
    "key": "TWFsZm95",
    "value": "Ik11Z2dsZSI=",
}
```

Again, you can see the original value using base64 command line utility

```bash
echo Ik11Z2dsZSI= | base64 -d
```

As you can observe, no message was added, since the user used a curse word.

### Submit a tx with non curse word for banned user

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/broadcast_tx_commit?tx="sender:Malfoy,message:heroic"'
```

After a certain amount of time you will observe that tx was rejected in `checkTx` since the user has been already banned.

```bash
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":-1,"result":{"check_tx":{"code":3,"data":null,"log":"User is banned","info":"","gas_wanted":"0","gas_used":"0","events":[],"codespace":""},"tx_result":{"code":0,"data":null,"log":"","info":"","gasWanted":"0","gasUsed":"0","events":[],"codespace":""},"hash":"9B110D7648000037B8385562B15810C70E1957AF2F65790B3617CB84C9398536","height":"0"}}%
```
