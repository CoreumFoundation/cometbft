# Introduction to ABCI++

`ABCI++` is an evolution of ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) from CometBFT. It acts as an interface between CometBFT (a state machine replication engine) and the actual state machine being replicated (i.e. the application).

## ABCI++ Functions

### PrepareProposal

This function prepares a proposed block by processing transactions, performing any necessary validation or filtering, and adding or modifying data as needed.

### ProcessProposal

It allows a validator to perform application-dependent work in a proposed block. This enables features such as immediate block execution, and allows the Application to reject invalid blocks.

### ExtendVote

This function extends the votes with data from the voters (validators).

### VerifyVoteExtension

Validates the data added to the votes (the vote extensions).

### FinalizeBlock

When the consensus algorithm decides on a block, CometBFT uses FinalizeBlock to send the decided blockâ€™s data to the Application,
which uses it to transition its state, but MUST NOT persist it; persisting MUST be done during Commit.

### Commit

This function persists the finalized state changes to a durable storage system, ensuring that the changes are permanently stored and can be retrieved later.
